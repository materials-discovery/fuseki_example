* Example 1: simple example, based on the stain distribution, no native access rights management, and no initial setup. 
* Example 2: more elaborate, based on official jena upstream distribution by Apache. No explicit native user access rights (to be managed as in Example 1 by the encapsulating application, e.g., omi), and with initial setup for a few graphs and datasets with persistence.
